# Placer

Placer is a component of the European Project TANGO (http://tango-project.eu ).

Placer is distributed under a [GNU LGPL License, version 3.0 or above](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html).

## Description

Placer is a model-based tool that, given a model of heterogeneous (or at least multi-core) hardware and a task-based complex software, finds a mapping of the software tasks on the various processing elements of the hardware, together with a routing of the transmissions on the available busses, and provides a schedule for the tasks and transmissions.
The mapping can minimize either the run time, energy consumption, or both in a multi-objective fashion.

## Installation

### Requirements

Placer is an R&D Tool that runs on the JVM. As such it can run on any office machine running a JVM, with say 10Gb of RAM available for the tool.

To use Placer you need to install two pieces of software:
* [jdk1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
* [scala 2.11](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.11.8.html).

### Installation and configuration procedure

Just copy the .jar of the release, once with requirements are installed and run it through command line. 
In the repository, \data contains two examples: example1.json and smallExample.json and the output that should be produced by Placer: placement_of_example1.json and placment_of_smallExample.json, respectively

## Usage:

Placer is a command-line tool. A documentation of all parameter is available through the command line as well using the â€“help flag:

```
> java -jar Placer.jar --help

placer beta1
Usage: placer [options]

  --in <file>	the JSon file representing the placement problem
  --out <file>	the file where the JSon representing the placements will be stored
  --discrepancy <value> 	the maximal discrepancy to use during the search must be >=0 , lower is faster but incomplete, use 20 for instance (5 if in a hurry). default is MaxInt
  --timeLimit <value>	the maximal run time for Placer in seconds, default is MaxInt. In case of LNS it is taken as the time limit pers CP exploration.
  --verbose	prints some verbosities
  --license	prints license and stops
  --lns <value>	use LNS, only for single objective goal (minMakespan,minEnergy,...) not for sat or Pareto
  --lnsMaxFails <value>	for LNS: the maximal number of fail per CP search default is 2000
  --lnsRelaxProba <value>	for LNS: the probability (in percentage) to maintain an element from one solution to the relaxed one, default is 90
  --lnsNbRelaxations <value> 	for LNS: the total number of relaxation to try out, default is 500
  --lnsNbRelaxationNoImprove <value>	for LNS: the maximal number of consecutive relaxation without improvement, default is 200
  --help	prints this usage text

Note: Placer is a java software so that all options taken by the JVM also apply. Among them, you should consider the -Xmx and -Xms parameters to grant more memory to Placer.

example: java -Xms4G -Xmx15G -jar Placer.jar --in=...
```



another example of usage:
notice that OscaR is quite verbose during its execution, even if verbosities are disabled.

```
> java -Xms5G -Xmx20G Placer.jar  --in=aquascanDemo1.json
		--out=aquascanOut1.json --timeLimit=10
